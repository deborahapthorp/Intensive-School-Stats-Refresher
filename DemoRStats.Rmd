## R Markdown

This is an R Markdown document. Markdown is a simple formatting syntax for authoring HTML, PDF, and MS Word documents. For more details on using R Markdown see <http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com>.

When you click the **Knit** button a document will be generated that includes both content as well as the output of any embedded R code chunks within the document. You can embed an R code chunk like this:

```{r import data,include=FALSE}
library(readr)
Qdata <- read_csv("~/Dropbox/Questionnaires/Analyses/Questionnaire_responses_VBM_Batch1.csv")

```

## Including Plots

You can also embed plots, for example:

```{r plot correlation, echo=FALSE,  warning=FALSE}
ggplot(Qdata, aes(x=Age, y=SQRT_n_FacebookFriends)) +
    geom_point(shape=1) +    # Use hollow circles
    geom_smooth(method=lm,color="black") +  # Add linear regression line 
                             #  (by default includes 95% confidence region)
  labs(x="Age", y = "Sqrt # FB Friends")+
  theme_classic() 

```

Note that the `echo = FALSE` parameter was added to the code chunk to prevent printing of the R code that generated the plot.
