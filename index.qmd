## Can’t I wait till I get the data?

-   No!!! It’s much better if you understand what you’re doing BEFORE you even collect any data
-   Then you can design a good study that will produce results you can interpret easily
-   There are some things you may not have learned (or have forgotten) in undergrad that will be helpful to know now
-   You should be able to write your Methods and Analysis sections before you even see the data (and ideally, **preregister** the project).

## Preregistration

![[OSF guide to preregistrations](https://help.osf.io/article/330-welcome-to-registrations)](images/osf_registries.png)

## Guide to Preregistration and Registered Reports

-   You submit a public time-stamped plan BEFORE you analyse your data (preferably before you collect it)

-   If you submit this for peer review, it's called a Registered Report

|-------------------|--------------------------|----------------------------|
| [SPSS](https://www.ibm.com/spss)      | Powerful, reasonably simple, you already know how to use it                                    | Expensive, too much output, need to run analysis again if you get it wrong, terrible graphs  |
| [jamovi](https://www.jamovi.org/)    | FREE, very simple to use, intuitive, makes nice graphs, powerful, lots of help online          | May not have some of the more complex analyses you need, your supervisor may need persuading |
| [JASP](https://jasp-stats.org/)      | FREE, also simple to use, fantastic for Bayesian analyses, also does SEM and machine learning! | Not quite as good for non-parametric tests and traditional stats, graphs not as pretty       |
| [R/RStudio](https://posit.co/downloads/) | FREE, extremely powerful, makes AMAZING plots, best for replicability                          | Steep learning curve, sometimes not super easy to interpret output, need to Google a lot     |

## Statistics languages

## What statistic to use?

-   Questions to start with: What is your dependent variable? What is/are your independent variable/s?
-   Is your design between-subjects or within-subjects?
-   Is your DV interval/ratio (continuous) or categorical?
-   Are your IVs interval/ratio (continuous) or categorical, or both?
-   Are your assumptions \[likely to be\] met?
-   [Handy flowchart here](https://www.statsflowchart.co.uk)
-   Also a mobile app & website, [StatHand](https://www.stathand.net/Home/About) - written by our own Adam Rock

## Some examples

-   Are people better at recognising upright faces compared to upside-down ones?
    -   Extension: is this different for faces compared to objects?
-   Do people who recall their dreams more often perform better on a short-term memory task?
    -   Extension: Is this relationship affected by poor sleep?
-   Did more men than women drop out of your experiment?

## Expectation vs. reality

-   Your data will probably look very different to the datasets you are used to!

## Data integrity tips

-   ALWAYS save your data in a non-proprietary format (.csv is best).
-   Avoid saving multiple versions if possible. Do save a raw version and a minimally processed version (e.g. deleting non-completers), but after that try to use filters rather than deleting participants.
-   BACK UP!!!
-   Keep a copy of your syntax for making scales etc. (if using SPSS). This will save you a lot of work. (Can also save a template in jamovi, or save the R code.) I’ll show you how in a minute.
-   Really good preprint [here](https://psyarxiv.com/5tmfe/) about principles of data management

## Data carpentry

### Sometimes known as data cleaning

-   You’ll have participants who haven’t completed your surveys/experiments
-   You’ll have participants who don’t meet inclusion criteria
-   You might have people who did the survey twice
-   Sometimes you need to compile 2 datasets (e.g. at two timepoints). HANDY HINT - do NOT let participants generate their own random code. Have Qualtrics do it for you.
-   You’ll need to compute scales and subscales (e.g. DASS Depression, Anxiety, Stress) - may need to reverse-score items first
-   You might want to check outliers (if real and not data error, think CAREFULLY before excluding them).

## Creating scales

-   Most survey-type studies will consist of established scales with published reliability figures and scoring systems
-   Make sure you ALWAYS check reliability in your own sample as well
-   You’ll need to sum or average items to create your scale and/or subscale (also, only use validated cutoff scores)
-   Sometimes you need to re-score items (e.g. reverse scaled, scored in a different way by Qualtrics)

## Correlations - a cautionary tale

![](images/cautionary_correlations.png){.absolute top="100" right="150" width="700"}

- All these correlations are $r(50) = .5$
- [Code available here](https://github.com/janhove/cannonball)
- **Visualise your data**! 


## Reporting results

::: columns
::: {.column width="70%"}
-   Try to report as much detail as possible (means/mean difference, SD, test stat, df, p-value, effect size and 95% confidence interval)
-   APA format!!! Make sure you do it right!
-   Tables are good for stats (but format them properly!)
-   [You can make SPSS produce APA style tables!!](http://www.statsmakemecry.com/smmctheblog/how-to-make-spss-produce-all-tables-in-apa-format-automatica.html)
-   Good graphs can make all the difference in your thesis (but DON’T cut & paste straight from SPSS)

## Make nice graphs!

![](images/nicegraphs.png)


## What to do when assumptions aren’t met



-   Non-parametric tests (Mann-Whitney U, Spearman’s Rank Correlations, Friedman ANOVA)
-   Transform data? (log, square root, inverse - ONLY for interval/ratio variables)
-   Poisson regression, ordinal logistic regression, negative binomial regression (all available in SPSS under the Generalized Linear Model menu, or in jamovi’s GLM add-on)
-   Bootstrapping is another possibility (although debatable) - available in SPSS

## Surprising/controversial things

::: columns 
::: {.column width="70%"}
-   Dichotomising or grouping variables can reduce statistical power considerably (e.g. low/med/high instead of summed scores)
-   Using metric models (e.g. ANOVA, regression) for ordinal data (e.g. Likert scales) can seriously distort your results (see [this article](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0022103117307746) - blog post digest [here](psychbrief.com/dont-analyse-ordinal-like-interval-ratio/)).
-   Moderation is mathematically exactly the same thing as interaction in regression
-   Mediation using correlational designs has been heavily criticised (see [here](www2.psych.ubc.ca/~schaller/528Readings/BullockGreenHa2010.pdf), for instance).
